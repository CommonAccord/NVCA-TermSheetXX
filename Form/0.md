OrigNote=Preliminary Note

OrigNote=This term sheet maps to the NVCA Model Documents, and for convenience the provisions are grouped according to the particular Model Document in which they may be found.  Although this term sheet is somewhat longer than a “typical” VC Term Sheet, the aim is to provide a level of detail that makes the term sheet useful as both a road map for the document drafters and as a reference source for the business people to quickly find deal terms without the necessity of having to consult the legal documents (assuming of course there have been no changes to the material deal terms prior to execution of the final documents).  For Series B and later transactions, consider substantially shortening to refer to deal terms being “consistent with prior rounds, subject to reasonable review by Lead Investor” (as noted in the prior sentence, deal terms often are negotiated further between term sheet and closing, so relying on a term sheet for one round in a later round may prove inaccurate).
